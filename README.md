THIS IS NOT MY PROJECT. You can find the original location of it [here](https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd).
This repository merely exists to preserve it as an easily buildable copy, as the original source used a strange MonoGame layout.
I've provided a build artifact with the relevant `dotnet` version bundled, for easy usage of the project under `wine`, as that's how I would use it.
